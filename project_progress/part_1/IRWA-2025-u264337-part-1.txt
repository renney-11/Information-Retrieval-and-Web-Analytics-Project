Part 1:

3. Handling category, sub_category, brand, product_details, seller
My approach would be to handle each field separately rather than merging them into a single text field.
This is beaucuse these fields are distinctive and carry different types of information relevant to retrieval.
By indexing them separately the search system can assign different weights to each field, which helps rank 
results more accurately based on which specific fields match the user's query.
The pros is that it improves retrieval accuracy and gives us more flexibility when handling queries.
The con on the other hand is that the indes becomes more complex and requires the search system to handle multiple 
fields quring a query proccess.
An alternative approach would be to merge all fields to a single text field, this would simplify the index but there is a risk
of losing the distinctiveness of each field which can result in worse retriaval precision.

4. For the fields out_of_stock, selling_price, discount, actual_price, and average_rating, I would not to index them as textual terms.
Beacuse these fields represants boolean or numeric attributes, not free text. By keeping them in their types the filtering would be more
efficient. Ex: selling_price and actual_price are numeric, enabling price-based queries, discount is numeric for discount-based filtering,
 average_rating is numeric to support ranking by rating, and out_of_stock is boolean for availability checks.
 Treating them as text would make numerical comparisons inefficient and reduce retrieval effectiveness.
 The main trade-off is that handling these fields requires slightly more complex query processing compared to pure text indexing.
